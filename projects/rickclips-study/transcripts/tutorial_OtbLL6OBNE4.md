[00:00] Look at these two videos.  
[00:01] This one has 29 million views and it's not a one-off.  
[00:05] That channel is brand new and its last 80 shorts  
[00:08] got over 200 million views.  
[00:10] The other one, that's mine.  
[00:12] And no, it didn't come out of an AI video generator.  
[00:15] Claude built it in 3D with code every single frame.  
[00:18] In this video, I'll show you exactly  
[00:21] how I made this animated short,  
[00:22] how I trained Claude on this style frame by frame,  
[00:25] what went wrong and how I fixed it  
[00:27] and how you can get it too.  
[00:29] You're going to get all of that for completely free.  
[00:33] All right, let's get into it.  
[00:34] If you've never seen this type of short, it's this.  
[00:36] The characters are 2D, but the world around them is 3D.  
[00:40] So how do you train Claude to make this?  
[00:42] First, you need references, a lot of them.  
[00:45] I went to the channel and had Claude download  
[00:47] the last 20 shorts in this style.  
[00:49] The ones that look this good.  
[00:50] Now, here's the thing.  
[00:51] If you just tell Claude to analyze a video,  
[00:53] it won't look at every frame.  
[00:55] It grabs a few here and there,  
[00:57] but a normal video runs at 30 frames per second  
[00:59] and you've probably seen this style all over your feed.  
[01:02] Most of those look trash.  
[01:04] The reason is the tiny stuff, micro animations,  
[01:07] a little camera move, a little shading, a little light,  
[01:09] that's what makes it feel real  
[01:11] and you only catch that at 30 frames per second.  
[01:14] Every single frame, every camera move,  
[01:16] every little change in the light.  
[01:17] So that's the main thing I told Claude.  
[01:19] Watch all of them at 30 frames per second  
[01:22] and check everything, the lighting, the contrast,  
[01:25] the shadows, the movement, the effects, the cuts,  
[01:27] everything, 20 shorts, about 18 minutes of video,  
[01:31] over 32,000 frames and it came back with a rule book.  
[01:35] So what's the actual workflow behind these shorts?  
[01:38] It comes down to three layers,  
[01:39] how the script is engineered,  
[01:41] how the visuals are constructed  
[01:43] and how Claude measured all of it.  
[01:44] First, the script.  
[01:46] To decode it, Claude needed the audio  
[01:48] and the first time, YouTube handed it the German dub.  
[01:51] Classic.  
[01:52] So it pulled the original English track  
[01:54] and transcribed all 20 itself  
[01:56] and every single one opens like this.  
[01:58] They buried a man alive with a bell tied to his finger.  
[02:01] He bet his life savings on the slowest horse in the race.  
[02:04] A knight paid a priest to forgive a crime  
[02:06] he hadn't committed yet.  
[02:08] There's a button in the middle of town  
[02:09] and nobody's allowed to press it.  
[02:11] A paradox in the very first sentence,  
[02:14] no intro, no setup, then it escalates.  
[02:17] Then comes the pivot where the real reason comes out.  
[02:19] Then the payoff, one last line and the twist lands  
[02:23] and there's a signature move.  
[02:24] 14 of the 20 flip into the explanation  
[02:27] with the exact same two words.  
[02:29] You see, you see, you see, you see, you see.  
[02:32] And the delivery is relentless.  
[02:34] Almost four words a second with basically zero dead air.  
[02:37] Second, the visuals.  
[02:38] The characters are flat, two dimensional,  
[02:40] but they're lit like they physically exist in that world.  
[02:43] They catch the key light and they cast real shadows.  
[02:46] The world is real 3D geometry,  
[02:48] traced with black ink outlines like a comic book.  
[02:51] The colors are heavily saturated.  
[02:53] Warm highlights, cool blue shadows.  
[02:55] And the lighting follows the story.  
[02:56] Warm and bright while it sets things up,  
[02:58] then a deep night blue right as the explanation begins.  
[03:01] And the camera almost never cuts.  
[03:04] 12 of the 20 have one hard cut or none at all.  
[03:06] Instead, the camera physically travels into the next moment.  
[03:10] Third, and this is the real secret,  
[03:12] how Claude analyzed all of it.  
[03:14] It didn't just eyeball it,  
[03:15] it wrote its own measuring tool.  
[03:17] Every two seconds of video became one contact sheet.  
[03:20] 60 frames on a single image, 549 of them.  
[03:23] Then it tracked the camera with phase correlation,  
[03:26] measuring how far the image shifts frame by frame.  
[03:29] It flagged every hard cut.  
[03:30] And it measured the brightness, the contrast,  
[03:32] and the saturation of every short.  
[03:34] That's how it found that in about 80% of the frames,  
[03:37] the camera is almost perfectly still, just tiny drifts.  
[03:41] So here's the tip.  
[03:42] Don't ask Claude what it thinks of a video.  
[03:44] Make it measure.  
[03:45] You can't recreate an opinion, you can recreate a number.  
[03:48] So now I had the whole blueprint.  
[03:50] Now, the story.  
[03:51] We made the same type of short, but with our own story.  
[03:54] Same lighting, same camera, same cuts,  
[03:57] same script formula, just our own characters.  
[04:00] My first topic was why time seems to slow down  
[04:03] when you're in danger?  
[04:04] But while Claude studied the 20,  
[04:06] it noticed one of them already covered  
[04:07] the exact same experiment with 5.7 million views.  
[04:11] So we threw it out and picked a new story.  
[04:14] One the channel had never told.  
[04:15] 1831, 74 soldiers march across an iron bridge,  
[04:19] all in step, and one end of the bridge  
[04:21] drops into the river.  
[04:23] Before writing a single word, Claude checked every fact.  
[04:26] The date, the number of soldiers,  
[04:28] even how deep the river was, two feet.  
[04:30] And that turned into the best joke in the whole short.  
[04:33] Luckily, the river was only two feet deep.  
[04:36] Unluckily, the river was only two feet deep.  
[04:39] Then it wrote the script with the exact formula from the 20,  
[04:43] a paradox in the very first line.  
[04:45] 74 soldiers knocked down an iron bridge  
[04:48] just by walking across it.  
[04:50] Then it builds up, then you see, then the twist.  
[04:53] After that, Claude started building.  
[04:55] At first, it used blender, same as my very first test.  
[04:59] Before any of this, I asked Claude  
[05:01] for a quick five second test, just to see the look.  
[05:03] Claude designed its own character, a little courier.  
[05:06] It grabbed free 3D buildings, made flat cartoon clouds,  
[05:10] and matched the camera timing from the channel's frames.  
[05:12] There was just one problem.  
[05:14] On the third camera push,  
[05:15] the camera flew right past the character.  
[05:17] So for the bridge, Claude started in blender again.  
[05:20] It tested the ink lines there,  
[05:21] and drew the whole cast in code.  
[05:23] Soldiers, an officer, people from the town,  
[05:26] a kid, and a parent.  
[05:27] Then I had a hunch.  
[05:29] Maybe these shorts are made with 3JS.  
[05:31] That's 3D built with code right in the browser.  
[05:34] Claude checked the frames, flat characters,  
[05:36] standing in a real 3D world.  
[05:38] 3JS can do exactly that.  
[05:40] So it moved everything over,  
[05:42] and Remotion turns it into a video, frame by frame.  
[05:45] Then it built the world.  
[05:47] 37 free 3D models.  
[05:49] Trees, rocks, flowers, market stalls, a cart,  
[05:53] even a windmill, and every texture.  
[05:55] The grass, the cobblestones, the roofs, the water,  
[05:58] was painted by code.  
[05:59] The characters got 14 different faces.  
[06:01] Laughing, whistling, nervous, shocked.  
[06:04] Then the bridge.  
[06:05] Two towers, iron chains, and a deck five meters wide.  
[06:09] 74 soldiers march across it, four side by side.  
[06:12] Every step makes it bounce,  
[06:14] and the bounce keeps growing until it snaps.  
[06:16] For the ink lines, Claude wrote its own effect.  
[06:19] It finds the edges in the 3D world  
[06:21] and draws a black line on them.  
[06:22] About an hour after the switch,  
[06:24] all 15 shots were working, 2,025 frames.  
[06:28] But before rendering any video,  
[06:29] Claude checked still frames.  
[06:31] Good thing it did.  
[06:32] In three shots, the camera was stuck inside a house.  
[06:35] The trees were teal, and a chain was right in front  
[06:38] of everyone's faces.  
[06:39] While Claude was fixing that,  
[06:40] I put one of our frames next to the original,  
[06:42] and it looked cheap.  
[06:44] Here's what I told Claude.  
[06:45] The original is colorful, high contrast.  
[06:48] It looks premium.  
[06:49] Ours looks dull.  
[06:51] So go analyze it, frame by frame.  
[06:53] Take your time.  
[06:54] Use 10 agents if you have to.  
[06:55] Just make it as close as you possibly can.  
[06:58] And Claude agreed.  
[06:59] Ours looked cheap.  
[07:00] Then it broke down exactly why.  
[07:02] The original has black ink lines on the whole 3D world.  
[07:06] Ours had almost none.  
[07:07] Their colors are bold, with long blue shadows  
[07:10] and deep darks.  
[07:11] Ours were pastel and flat.  
[07:13] Their wood and stone look hand-painted.  
[07:15] You can see the grain and the dark gaps  
[07:17] between the planks.  
[07:18] Ours were plain.  
[07:19] Their backgrounds are blurry,  
[07:21] so your eye goes straight to the character.  
[07:23] Ours were mostly sharp.  
[07:24] And the characters.  
[07:25] Theirs have egg-shaped heads and thin little limbs.  
[07:28] Ours had perfect circle heads and chunky bodies.  
[07:31] They looked like clip art pasted on top.  
[07:33] And this is where it gets interesting.  
[07:35] I asked for 10 agents.  
[07:37] Claude used 12.  
[07:38] And it didn't just throw them at the problem.  
[07:40] It built a team.  
[07:41] Seven agents to study the gap.  
[07:43] One for color, one for the ink lines,  
[07:45] one for light and shadows,  
[07:47] one for textures, one for the characters,  
[07:49] one for depth and framing,  
[07:51] and one for motion, the camera and the characters.  
[07:53] Each one put the original frames next to ours  
[07:56] and measured the difference.  
[07:58] No guessing, real numbers.  
[07:59] An eighth agent worked on the sound.  
[08:01] Then four more agents to rebuild everything.  
[08:04] One for the camera, one for the world,  
[08:06] one for the characters and one for the final look.  
[08:09] But here's the problem.  
[08:10] Four agents working on the same project  
[08:12] can break each other's work.  
[08:13] So Claude gave each one its own copy of the project.  
[08:17] And each agent owned its own files.  
[08:19] Nobody else could touch them.  
[08:21] When they were done, Claude merged everything back,  
[08:23] file by file.  
[08:24] So here's the tip.  
[08:25] When you use a lot of agents,  
[08:27] don't just split the jobs, split the files.  
[08:30] Then I gave Claude 10 hours.  
[08:32] 10 hours to learn this style and make the finished video.  
[08:35] Here's what the seven agents found.  
[08:37] First, the ink lines.  
[08:39] The original has black lines on almost three  
[08:41] out of four edges.  
[08:42] On ours, the agent found zero.  
[08:44] The ink effect was there,  
[08:46] but the blur effect ran in the same step and wiped it out.  
[08:49] And the blur itself, it was so weak,  
[08:51] you couldn't see it anywhere.  
[08:52] Next, the camera.  
[08:53] Ours snapped from one spot to the next in three frames.  
[08:57] The original glides over about 23 frames.  
[09:00] Slow in, slow out.  
[09:02] Then the color.  
[09:02] The original has no pure black anywhere.  
[09:05] Ours went almost black.  
[09:06] And at sunset, their shadows are purple.  
[09:08] Ours were brown.  
[09:10] And the characters.  
[09:11] Their bodies are three and a half heads tall.  
[09:13] Ours were under three.  
[09:14] And our arms and legs were five times too thick.  
[09:17] But the agents also found something I didn't expect.  
[09:20] Some of our own notes were wrong.  
[09:22] Remember the egg-shaped heads?  
[09:23] The agent measured 38 of them.  
[09:25] Their heads are actually rounder than ours.  
[09:27] Ours were the egg-shaped ones.  
[09:29] And remember the measuring tool from the start?  
[09:31] It said the camera is almost still 80% of the time.  
[09:34] It's not.  
[09:35] The camera is moving in 65% of the frames,  
[09:37] slowly pushing in.  
[09:39] The tool just couldn't see moves that slow.  
[09:41] And this is exactly the part other tutorials skip.  
[09:44] I found only two other tutorials on this style.  
[09:47] One sells it inside an app.  
[09:49] $67 a month.  
[09:50] Or $97 for everything.  
[09:53] The other one gives you a few prompts.  
[09:55] And it says your first results might not look as clean.  
[09:58] So here's how you can get mine.  
[10:00] Everything from this video.  
[10:01] Every rule and every fix I save as one skill for Claude.  
[10:05] And I'm giving it away, fully free on my GitHub.  
[10:08] You get the whole repository  
[10:09] with 5,000 reference images.  
[10:12] The link is in the description.  
[10:13] So you don't have to do anything.  
[10:15] Just install it and start making videos.  
[10:17] Everything is already set up.  
[10:18] So the output should be as polished as it gets.  
[10:21] And I'm going to keep uploading new things there.  
[10:23] I'll keep updating it and making it better.  
[10:26] And you get all of that for free.  
[10:27] And here's one more thing.  
[10:29] I'm making a video on it tomorrow.  
[10:30] This realistic 3D video.  
[10:32] As you can see, I made it.  
[10:34] That's my name on it.  
[10:35] Here's something wild.  
[10:36] Pull every blood vessel out of your body  
[10:39] and lay them in one straight line.  
[10:41] Most people guess it would reach across a football field.  
[10:43] Not even close.  
[10:45] Your body hides billions of microscopic tubes  
[10:48] branching through every muscle, every organ, even your bones.  
[10:51] Lay them all out and the line would leave your city  
[10:54] across entire countries, stretch over oceans  
[10:56] and keep on going.  
[10:58] Scientists estimate about 100,000 kilometers.  
[11:01] That's enough to wrap around the whole earth  
[11:03] roughly two and a half times.  
[11:05] Just so you know, I've never seen anything like this  
[11:08] made with AI.  
[11:08] Other people have made this style with Claude,  
[11:10] but not like this.  
[11:12] I looked and I couldn't find a single tutorial  
[11:14] that gets this close.  
[11:16] If this showed up on your feed,  
[11:17] you'd never guess AI touched it.  
[11:19] In that video, I'll show you exactly how I made it.  
[11:22] How to animate a realistic face  
[11:23] with an open source AI model.  
[11:25] How to rig the character for free on your own computer.  
[11:28] How to make the world look real.  
[11:30] How to cut the render from seven and a half hours  
[11:32] to one hour.  
[11:33] And how to render it smaller than upscale it  
[11:36] so it renders as fast as it gets.  
[11:38] You can find the skill and everything in the description.  
[11:40] The link to the GitHub repository is right there,  
[11:43] completely free.  
[11:44] That's all for today.  
[11:45] Make sure to subscribe and like.  
[11:47] And with this type of workflow,  
[11:48] you can pretty much clone any style.  
[11:50] Bye.
